 * The seam every native build goes through.

 * implementations of the same contract rather than three shapes the helper has
 * to know about. Only two exist here: a fake one, which is what R7's acceptance
 * runs against, and EAS, which refuses until R9 has produced a project to build.
 *
 * The interface is deliberately narrow. A builder is handed a staged file and a
 * target and reports back; it is not given the socket, the job store or the
 * client. Anything a builder could say that should not reach a browser passes
 * through the sanitizer on the way out, and a builder that could bypass that by
 * writing to the client directly would make the sanitizer decorative.
